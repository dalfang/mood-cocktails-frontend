      <h1>About Mood Cocktails</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Mood Cocktails, where every sip tells a story. Born in the fiery 
        pits of a weekend coding bootcamp, three spirited adventurers (literally) 
        mixed their skills to create an app that matches your mood with the perfect cocktail.
      </p>

        It all started on a rainy afternoon when the idea struck like a lemon twist 
        in a dry martini. Why not blend the art of mixology with the science of software? 
        The rest, as they say, is history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between debugging and distilling, we've poured our passion into this project 
        to ensure that whether you're feeling joyful, melancholic, or downright mysterious, 
        thereâ€™s a cocktail waiting to match your mood.
